# üåä Workflow
When beginning a new software based project it is best to begin planning on the workflow for the project to see what best suites the project and can result in delivering the best final product most effectively.
In this case, the project will be using the agile methodology and a break down of why it was chosen, some of the advantages and disadvantages and finally why it was chosen in favour of some other workflow methodologies.

## What is agile?
The official definition for agile is as follows:

> ‚ÄúA set of values and principles for software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing cross-functional teams.‚Äù

However, that definition is overtly complex. To break it down a bit more, agile was designed by with the tech industry at the core and as such focuses primarily on a fast product turnaround and the ability to modify the the product rapidly over the development period.

## Alternatives to agile:

### Scrum:
The scrum methodology is based on the principle that your requirements are constantly changing and the workflow can be changed and adapted to new requirements quickly. It allows for feedback to be taken and the end product be adapted to meet new requirements much quicker.

Pros:
- Very efficient in delivering a new product as quickly as possible.
- Works well for fast moving projects.
- Development sprints allow for quick adaption based on feedback.
- Ensures the best use of time and money.

Cons:
- Daily catch-up meetsing often results in members frustration.
- Does not work well in large scale teams.
- Maximum commitment & co-operation required in order not to fail.
- Members leaving the project mid-development can have a hugely negative impact on the project.
- Can often result in "scope-creep" where no definitive end date is visible.

### Waterfall:
This is one of the much older workflow methodologies that was presented as a way of reducing risk by outlining all the steps of the project from the start, such to have a clearer view of what to expect.
The core concept behind waterfall was that if you spend more time at the start of a project outlining the requirements and overall design of the project, then executing production of the project will go much smoother and flow better, like a waterfall.

Pros:
- Best suited for mission critical projects or projects with high levels of complexity.
- Works better for larger scale projects with larger teams of people.

Cons:
- Lack of flexibility and ability to modify later into development.
- Level of risk is much higher overall.
- Often requires breaking large teams down into smaller sub-teams.
- High levels of communication required between all teams.

## Why agile?
There are many different variants of workflow methodologies available and all have their own advantages and disadvantages. But after a lot of careful consideration and in-depth research of many of the most widely used methodologies, the methodology best suited for the product that is due to be created and to meet the requirements listed is agile.
Agile was selected for the following reasons:
- Flexibility allows for quicker product adaptation.
- Rapid time to turn over final product.
- Best suited for software based development.

## Advantages / Disadvantages of agile:
**Pros:** 
- Very flexible and can be modified later to meet new requirements.
- Time to turn over a final product is much faster.
- Best suited for creative/programming based projects.
- Encourages better communication between developers.

**Cons:** 
- Concept is basic in understanding but hard in execution.
- Can result in more pressure being put on developers.
- Requires high levels of collaboration from all members.
- Can be more challenging on larger scale projects.
