# ‚è≥ History
Rust first began as a personal project in 2006 by Graydon Hoare, a Mozilla employee who stated that the project was possibly named after the rust family of fungi.
Three years (2009) of development later, the project was then sponsored by Mozilla and just one year (2010) later, released to the public.

Later that same year development began on creating a new self-hosted compiler written in Rust with LLVM as its backend. This would take over the current initial compiler that was being used that was originally created using OCaml.
One year later (2011) the compiler was officially named "rustc" and released to the public.

In 2012 the first official pre-alpha was released to the public and began adoption slowly by the open source community.
However, after three more years of development on the project, in 2015, Rust 1.0 was released and was the first ever stable release of the language. Following this, the stable release candidate schedule was announced.
Every six weeks a new stable release candidate would be announced and released to the public. Whereas the latest features would remain reserved for the "nightly" branch before being tested on the beta branch before finally making their way into a stable release.
