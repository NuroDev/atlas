# ðŸ“‹ Objectives
Throughout the development of this project, there are multiple core objectives that 
are fundamental to this project and need to be fulfilled.
Those objectives are, in no particular order, as follows:

# Artifact:
When creating the two final artifacts, they will need to have feature sets as similar as possible
so there are no discrepancies when benchmarking the two platforms.
As such, the minimum feature set is as follows: 

 - Clean project structure

 - Continious integration & continious deployment support

 - Create a bare-bones game engine using OpenGL

	- Basic event loop

	- Basic graphical rendering (3D / 2D)

	- Basic user input (Mouse & keyboard)

 - Re-usable engine library (.dll / Rust crate)

 - Well structured & detailed API documentation

However, multiple possible additional features could be added to both platforms.
These features are not required but would be a nice addition, but only if the feature can be equally implemented.
But due to complexity and time restraints, they have been deemed optional:

 - Basic audio system

 - Basic parallelism

 - Basic physics system

 - Cross-platform support

 - Gamepad input support

 - ImGui or alternative support

 - Mesh file loading

 - Multi-graphical backend support

 - Text rendering
